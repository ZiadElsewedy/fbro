**Last updated:** 2026-06-20 (Premium UI redesign — Schedule · Admin Home · Task timeline)
**Version:** 1.0.0+1 · **Branch:** `feature/tasks-improvements` (DROP — monochrome enterprise UX)

> **Premium UI redesign (2026-06-20):** Visual refinement pass (monochrome,
> token-driven, no schema/logic change). ① **Branch Schedule** rebuilt for
> density/premium — compact **date-rail + shift-lane** day cards (`_dateRail`/
> `_shiftLane`), round **+** add affordance, refined avatar chips, tighter padding.
> ② **Admin Home** tightened — single-line greeting (`h1`), reduced section gaps,
> a denser hero (metric beside title+summary, throughput in the eyebrow). ③ **Task
> timeline** upgraded to rich **event cards** (status badge + `activityIcon`,
> actor avatar + role, quoted note, attachment thumbnail). `flutter analyze` clean;
> 35 tests pass.

> **Product/UI verification pass (2026-06-20):** Driven by real-UI review — fixed
> things that were coded but **broken/unreachable in the actual flow**. ① **Admin
> Pending Actions was invisible** (gated behind `if (count > 0)`); now **always
> rendered** with an "all caught up" state, and **extracted to a public, widget-
> tested** component
> ([pending_actions.dart](lib/features/admin/presentation/widgets/pending_actions.dart)).
> ② **Branch Schedule "Unknown"** is a stale-reference bug (a uid whose owner left
> the branch); now **detected** (`isOrphanAssignment`), **surfaced** (warning
> banner + distinct "Unknown member · <uid>" chip), and **resolvable** (tap →
> confirm → remove, then reassign). ③ **Admin had no UI to see/approve swaps** —
> `ScheduleManagementScreen` is now a **two-tab** screen (Schedule · Swap Requests)
> with an **all-branches** queue (`ShiftSwapCubit.loadAll`/`SwapScope.all`/
> `getAllSwaps`), branch-labelled cards, and auto-refresh on approval. ④ **Employee
> no longer offered "Swap" on past shifts** (muted "Past" label, in lock-step with
> `SwapEligibility`). `flutter analyze` clean; **35 tests pass** (25 + 10 new incl.
> headless widget tests). ⚠️ True on-device click-through still requires a seeded
> admin + live Firebase (see QA note below) — Flutter UI isn't renderable in CI.

> **Shift-swap hardening + Admin Pending Actions (2026-06-20):** First slice of the
> Operations refinement spec. **§2 "future shifts only" swap validation** is now
> enforced in three layers — domain (new pure
> [`SwapEligibility`](lib/features/schedule/domain/swap_eligibility.dart):
> `slotStart` + `isRequestable`), the `ShiftSwapCubit.requestSwap` gate, the
> Request-Swap sheet, and a `firestore.rules` `shift_swaps` create backstop
> (`swapSlotInFuture` recomputes the slot start from `weekStart`/`day`/`shift` and
> requires `> request.time`). A past or in-progress shift can no longer be swapped.
> **§1 Admin Home "Pending Actions"** replaces the low-value "Recent activity" feed:
> a consolidated, actionable queue (Swap Requests · Employee Approvals · Tasks
> Waiting Review · Overdue Tasks), each a tappable row jumping to where it's
> resolved. New `ScheduleRepository.getAllSwaps()` + `ShiftSwapCubit.pendingSwaps()`
> give the admin all-branch swap visibility. No schema/entity/route change; no
> codegen. `flutter analyze` clean (0 issues); **25 tests pass** (17 + 8 new in
> `swap_eligibility_test.dart`). ⚠️ Deploy `firestore.rules` for the server backstop.

> **Admin command-center redesign + component library (2026-06-19):** Premium
> rebuild of the **Admin** experience on a new shared component library — keeping
> the existing **strictly-monochrome** `AppColors` (owner kept the palette).
> **New `core/widgets`:** `GlassContainer` (the one shared premium surface —
> gradient·border·depth·press/hover; `HeroStatCard` + `AdminUserCard` refactored
> onto it), `DashboardMetricCard`, `ActionCard`, `AdminSectionHeader`,
> `TimelineTile` (generic vertical timeline). The `TaskStatusChip` requirement is
> met by the existing `StatusBadge.task`. **Admin Home** (`admin_dashboard_screen.dart`)
> rebuilt into a command center: greeting header → focal **hero** (pending
> approvals → reviews → overdue → all-clear, with metric·summary·progress·CTA) →
> `DashboardMetricCard` overview grid → `ActionCard` quick actions → pending-
> approvals preview (read-only `AdminUsersCubit.pendingUsers()`) → recent-activity
> feed (`TimelineTile` from the live task `activityLog`) → Manage grid. Reads
> `StatisticsCubit` + the `TaskCubit` all-branches stream + pending users.
> **Employees page** now uses a new `EmployeeCard` (identity + active badge +
> Completed/Pending/Rate/Late metric strip) — metrics derived from the task stream
> via the pure `computeEmployeeMetrics` (`admin/presentation/employee_metrics.dart`,
> unit-tested). Task-details timeline + admin feed share `TimelineTile` +
> `activity_format.dart` (`activityTitle`/`activityColor`/`relativeTime`). The
> spec's event-based task timeline is **already** the `activityLog`/`ActivityEntry`
> model (rendered dynamically — missing/optional steps + rework loops supported).
> No schema/route/entity/rule change; no codegen. `flutter analyze` clean (0
> issues); **17 tests pass** (12 + 5 new in `employee_metrics_test.dart`).

> **Admin tasks setState fix (2026-06-19):** `AdminTaskOverviewScreen._load()` was
> calling `setState(() => _branchesFuture = context.read<TaskCubit>().branches())`
> — the `=>` arrow made the lambda return the Future, triggering Flutter's
> `setState() callback returned a Future` error at runtime. Fixed: the Future is
> now captured before `setState`, and the state update uses a block body (`{}`).
> Also resolved the 2 pre-existing `prefer_initializing_formals` linter infos
> (`AuthCubit._signInWithEmail`, `ProfileCubit._updateProfile`). `flutter analyze`
> clean — **0 issues**.

> **Employee schedule premium redesign (2026-06-19):** `my_schedule_screen.dart`
> rebuilt from scratch. `_MyWeekTab` is now a `StatefulWidget` with a single
> `AnimationController` (900 ms) and per-section staggered `FadeTransition` +
> `SlideTransition` (greeting 0–35%, hero card 15–55%, week header 30–60%, week
> rows staggered 40–90%). Greeting section shows time-based salutation ("Good
> morning/afternoon/evening, [FirstName] 👋") + formatted date. **Today hero card**
> redesigned: rounded-square shift icon, "TODAY" pill badge, shift name headline,
> time-range + "In Xm" countdown pill (appears when shift starts within 2 h),
> two-column Manager + Working-with section (avatar + name + role label; named
> avatar stack with first-name summary), "View Shift Details" tappable divider row
> → `_ShiftDetailsSheet` modal with full team list. **Week rows** (all 7 days,
> Sun → Sat): `_DayChip` (3-letter abbrev + date number; today gets white filled
> box + dark text); shift icon circle; shift name + time; Swap / Today pill /
> "—" action. Notification bell added to app bar (cosmetic). `flutter analyze`
> clean (2 pre-existing infos).

> **Employee home redesign v2 (2026-06-18):** `employee_home_screen.dart` rebuilt
> into a live command center — an animated **circular progress ring** hero
> (`_RingPainter` CustomPaint, sweep + count-up) + today's shift, a count-up
> **stat strip**, and an **actionable** task list (Start a pending task inline →
> `TaskCubit.startTask`; Continue / View feedback; body tap → `TaskDetailsScreen`).
> All task counts/sections come from the **live `TaskCubit` stream** (ground
> truth — fixes the old "In progress" chip always reading 0, since `employeeStats`
> never sets `activeTasks`); only the shift comes from `StatisticsCubit`. Staggered
> entrances, `_Pressable` press feedback, last-good-snapshot cache (no flicker on
> inline actions), route-guarded error snackbars, "Open all tasks" → Tasks tab.
> Strictly monochrome; presentation-only (no new files/routes/cubits/schema).
> `flutter analyze` clean (2 pre-existing infos).

> **App branding (2026-06-18):** App icon replaced with DROP branding image on Android + iOS (all sizes auto-generated). App display name changed to **DROP** (AndroidManifest + Info.plist). Dart package name stays `fbro` internally.

> **Task workflow architecture (2026-06-18 — two passes):** Eliminated the double-write race condition and completed the single-write architecture. Every status transition is now one atomic `_updateTask` call that writes `status` + `activityLog` entry + per-transition audit timestamp in a single Firestore document write. **New fields:** `startedAt` (set by `startTask`) and `submittedAt` (set by `submitForReview` and `completeAndSubmit`), joining the existing `approvedAt`/`rejectedAt`. `ChangeTaskStatus` and `ReviewTask` use cases removed from `TaskCubit` (dormant on disk). `_canTransition` updated to include `started → waitingReview`. Freezed codegen re-run. `flutter analyze` clean (2 pre-existing infos only).
>
> **Task system pass (2026-06-19):** (1) **Proof-upload bug fixed** — `completeAndSubmit` now uploads proof **before** the status write, so a failed upload aborts the transition (task stays `started`, photo retained for retry) instead of silently submitting evidence-less work; the datasource maps Storage error codes to honest messages (unauthorized/object-not-found → "rules not deployed / Storage not enabled" instead of blaming the network) and adds a 60s upload timeout. (2) **Admin task experience redesigned** — `TaskManagementScreen` is now `AdminTaskOverviewScreen`: a branch overview (Active / Pending Review / Overdue / Completion Rate per branch, attention-sorted) with per-branch drill-down. (3) **Dead code removed** — `ChangeTaskStatus`/`ReviewTask` use-case files + the `updateStatus`/`reviewTask` repo+datasource chains + the unused `completeTask` cubit method; shared `ManagerTaskCard` + `startNewTaskFlow` de-duplicate manager/admin task UI. **Infra still required:** deploy `storage.rules` + ensure Firebase Storage is enabled, or proof uploads keep failing.

> **Inline checklist editor + form simplification (2026-06-18):** ① The Create/Edit Task form now has a fully **inline editable checklist** section (`_InlineChecklistEditor`). Managers tap "Add step" to add items, tap the star to toggle required/optional, tap × to remove. On create → items become `ChecklistItem`s; on edit → existing items preserve `completed`/`completedAt`, new items start uncompleted. Template-based tasks pre-populate the checklist editably (was read-only before). ② **"Type: daily/special" dropdown removed** from the form — it was visually redundant with "Repeats"; type is now auto-inferred (recurring → daily, one-off → special). `flutter analyze` clean.

> **Operations Workflow Upgrade + Product Review (2026-06-18):** Full enterprise task system on top of the existing architecture. **① Recurring Tasks** — `RecurrenceConfig` entity (frequency/interval/weekday/hour/minute) + `RecurrenceFrequency` enum; on approve `TaskCubit._spawnNextRecurrence` auto-creates the next task with checklist reset and deadline advanced; recurrence picker (chip row) in the task form. **② Activity Timeline** — `ActivityEntry` embedded array (`activityLog`) on every task; every status transition (create/start/submit/approve/reject) appends an entry with actor + timestamp + optional note; shown newest-first in the Task Details page. **③ Task Details Screen** (`task_details_screen.dart`) — full-screen scrollable: animated status/priority/deadline pills, assignee block with "Assigned by Name·Role", checklist with live progress bar, submitted work (notes + proof), activity timeline, role-appropriate action buttons. **④ Employee UX redesign** (`my_tasks_screen.dart`) — tabbed Active/Done, 5 sorted sections, animated entrance cards, slides into Task Details. **⑤ Product-review UX fix:** the two-step "Complete → re-open → Submit for Review" friction eliminated; `TaskCubit.completeAndSubmit` uploads proof + advances straight to `waitingReview` in one write; the "Mark Complete" expansion button is now **"Complete & Submit"**. `flutter analyze` clean. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

> **Task UX overhaul (2026-06-18):** ① **Proof-photo "User is not authorized" fixed**
> — it's Firebase **Storage `unauthorized`** (rules not deployed / Storage not
> enabled); the code is now **resilient** (proof is best-effort — a Storage failure
> no longer blocks completing the task or loses notes; precise warning shown) and the
> **manager Review sheet now shows the submitted notes + proof image**. ⚠️ Still must
> **enable Storage + deploy `storage.rules`** for uploads to actually work. ②
> **Upload-failure error is now shown on the right screen** — `_submit()` in
> `_CompleteButton` is now `async`/`await`-ed so the error snackbar fires while
> `TaskDetailsScreen` is still open (was previously shown on `MyTasksScreen` after
> the pop — easy to miss). Error message is user-friendly (no developer jargon). ②
> **Task cards redesigned** — monochrome, scannable, no priority rail / coloured
> chips / loud badges; colour reserved for **destructive** actions only. ③ **"Assigned
> by Name · Role"** added to cards (resolves `createdBy`). ④ **Username removed** from
> profile editing (no operational value; legacy social field). `flutter analyze`
> clean; 12 tests pass. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

> **DROP THE SHOP UI redesign (2026-06-17):** restructured the role chrome into a
> **bottom navigation bar** (Home · Tasks · Schedule · Profile) and redesigned the
> signature auth screens (splash brand lockup, the breathing-clock Pending Approval,
> login/register copy) — **keeping the strictly-monochrome black / white / grey
> palette** (owner confirmed B&W/grey stays; no indigo). Added the
> `app_bottom_nav.dart` widget + rebuilt `RoleScaffold`, plus token *names*
> (`onPrimary`, `primarySurface`, flat `primaryGlow`) consumed by the new chrome —
> `AppColors.primary` stays white. **Also fixed a pre-existing Tasks-screen crash**
> ("BoxConstraints forces an infinite height" in `TaskCard`'s priority rail → now a
> `Stack`/`PositionedDirectional`; regression test added). **No logic / routing /
> data / rule changes** (`git diff` = theme/widget/screen/doc only). The
> `assets/drop_logo.png` wordmark is preserved. `flutter analyze` clean; **11 tests
> pass**. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

> **Stability & UX Audit (2026-06-17):** hardened `UserModel`/`ProfileModel`
> `fromMap` against malformed docs (no more crash on a partial `users/{uid}`),
> simplified the role chrome to an overflow menu + **confirmed sign-out** (the
> overflow menu was later replaced by the **bottom-nav chrome** in the indigo
> redesign — Profile tab now carries Settings + Sign out), and
> standardized all auth/settings snackbars on `AppSnackbar`. Role separation,
> list states, and button flows audited clean.
>
> **De-duplication pass (2026-06-17):** extracted three shared utilities with no
> behaviour change — `context.currentUser`/`currentRole`
> ([context_extensions.dart](lib/core/extensions/context_extensions.dart), 13
> sites), `showConfirmDialog` ([app_dialog.dart](lib/core/widgets/app_dialog.dart),
> 3 dialogs), and `map.date()` for Firestore Timestamps
> ([firestore_extensions.dart](lib/core/extensions/firestore_extensions.dart), 21
> sites) — and removed dead code (`RolePlaceholder`) + 14 unused imports.
>
> **Shared component system (2026-06-17):** added `AppPasswordField` (login /
> register / change-password — 5 sites), `AppDropdownField<T>` (branch picker),
> `AppEmptyState` (`TaskEmptyState` now delegates), `AppCard` (surface·radius
> 24·press·hover — ready for adoption), and **`StatusBadge`** (`task_card`
> migrated; `.task`/`.approval`/`.swap`/`.active` factories); enhanced
> `AppTextField` (`readOnly`/`onTap`/`suffixIcon`, radius 20) and `context`
> (`isAdmin`/`isManager`/`isEmployee`, `showSuccess`/`showError`). **Next per the
> owner: a full Task Flow audit** (assignment · branch selection · admin task
> screen · employee task visibility). See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Working tree

- **Branch:** `feature/roles-and-foundation`.
- **Phase 1 (Roles & Foundation) implemented** — `UserRole` enum, extended
  user model, role seeding, role-based routing + guards, three role shells, and
  Firestore/Storage security rules. `flutter analyze` is clean.
- **Auth-flow rework** — removed the social **Welcome** page (landing is now
  **Login**); added the **account-approval gate**: new sign-ups are seeded
  `pending` + inactive and confined to a new **Pending Approval** screen
  (`/pending-approval`) until an admin approves them (`hasAppAccess` gate in the
  router; approval became **admin-only** in Phase 6). New `ApprovalStatus` enum +
  `approvalStatus` user field + `AuthCubit.refreshUser` (polled by the pending
  screen).
- **Phase 2 — Shift foundation** — *(deleted in Phase 10 as dead code; the weekly
  schedule superseded it.)* Was a data+domain `shift` feature with placeholder
  screens, never wired into a working UI.
- **Phase 3 — Task foundation** — new `task` feature: data + domain
  (`TaskEntity`/`TaskModel`/`TaskRepository(+Impl)`/`TaskRemoteDataSource(+Impl)`),
  `TaskType`/`TaskStatus`/`TaskPriority` enums, `tasks/{taskId}` Firestore rules,
  three role routes/screens, repo wired in DI.
- **Phase 4 — Task workflow (activated)** — `TaskCubit` + `TaskState` + 10 use
  cases; the three screens are now **functional**: employee My Tasks
  (start → complete with notes + optional proof image → submit for review,
  restart if rejected); manager Branch Tasks (flat list) / admin Task Management
  (now a **branch overview** with per-branch vitals + drill-down — see the
  2026-06-19 pass above) — both create, edit, assign employee from a branch
  picker, delete, review → approve/reject with notes. Added review **audit fields** (`approvedBy`/`approvedAt`/
  `rejectedBy`/`rejectedAt`/`reviewNotes`), **proof image upload** to Storage,
  **client-side status-transition validation** (`TaskCubit._canTransition`), and
  `AuthRepository.getUsersByBranch` (assignee picker). `TaskCubit` is provided
  app-wide in `main.dart`. No notifications / analytics (out of scope).
- **Phase 5 — Admin module** — new `branch` feature (full vertical slice +
  `BranchCubit`: CRUD, activate/deactivate, soft delete) and `admin` module
  (`UserAdminRepository` over `users/{uid}`, `AdminUsersCubit`): management
  screens for **branches, managers, employees, and pending approvals**
  (`/admin/branches|managers|employees|approvals`). Admin can approve/reject
  users, (de)activate, change role/branch, assign managers to branches, and move
  employees between branches. `branches/{branchId}` Firestore rules added.
  **Managers are promoted from existing approved users** (no client-side Auth
  account creation — no Cloud Functions). admin/branch cubits call repositories
  directly (no use-case layer).
- **Phase 6 — Dashboards & notifications** — new `statistics` feature
  (`StatisticsEntity`/`Model`/`Repository(+Impl)`/`RemoteDataSource` +
  `StatisticsCubit`) computes **role-scoped operational counts** (branch-scoped
  single-field queries + client-side aggregation). The admin / manager / employee
  home dashboards now render **live stats** via a shared `StatGrid`. Added the
  **FCM foundation** (`core/services/notification_service.dart` +
  `core/enums/notification_type.dart`): permission, device-token persistence on
  `users/{uid}.fcmToken`, foreground snackbars, wired in `main.dart`. **Approval
  made admin-only** — the manager user-write path was removed from
  `firestore.rules`. Replaced the Phase 5 `AdminStatsCubit` with `StatisticsCubit`.
- **Phase 7 — Weekly Schedule & Shift Swap** — new `schedule` feature (full
  vertical slice; repo-direct cubits like branch/admin). `WeeklyScheduleEntity`
  (nested `day → morning/night → [uid]` roster) + `ShiftSwapEntity`,
  `ScheduleRepository(+Impl)`/`ScheduleRemoteDataSource`, `ScheduleCubit` +
  `ShiftSwapCubit`. Managers build/edit their branch's weekly schedule (assign /
  remove employees, navigate weeks); admins pick any branch and override; employees
  see **My Week** (today's shift + team + manager) and request **shift swaps**
  (coworker approves → manager approves → schedule updates automatically). Routes
  `/admin/schedule`, `/manager/schedule`, `/my-schedule` (role chrome calendar
  icon → weekly Schedule). New collections `weekly_schedules` / `shift_swaps` with
  branch-scoped Firestore rules. `ScheduleDay` / `ScheduleShift` / `SwapStatus`
  enums + `ScheduleWeek` (deterministic doc id `<branchId>_<yyyy-MM-dd>`).
  **Dashboards integrated** — shift/coverage stats now come from the weekly
  schedule. `NotificationType` extended (swap + schedule events). `flutter analyze`
  clean.
- **Stabilization & Workflow Integration (branch `stabilization-and-optimization`)**
  — production-usability pass. Fixed a **broken build** (`pubspec.yaml` had
  `name:Drop` → restored `name: fbro`). Fixed **admin task assignment**: the task
  form's free-text branch field is replaced by a **Firestore-backed branch
  dropdown** (`TaskCubit.branches()` → `BranchRepository`), so a task's
  `branchId` always matches employees' `branchId` and the Assign picker is
  populated. **Task lists are now realtime** (`TaskRepository.watch*` streams
  drive `TaskCubit`) — an assigned task / status change shows immediately. Added
  **Task Templates** (new `task_templates` collection + `TaskTemplateEntity`/
  `Model`, repo/cubit CRUD, New-Task-from-template + Manage Templates UI). Fixed
  the **profile image freeze** (upload timeouts + smaller picked images +
  `cacheWidth` decode caps). Removed the now-dead one-shot task use cases. `flutter
  analyze` clean (2 pre-existing infos).
- **Phase 9 — Task UX, Admin UX & Design Overhaul (branch `claude/upbeat-knuth-7ch3wu`)**
  — premium-operations redesign, reusing the existing architecture. **Checklist
  templates:** `ChecklistItem` / `ChecklistItemTemplate` entities;
  `TaskTemplateEntity.checklistItems` + `TaskEntity.checklist`; create-from-template
  generates the checklist; **completion gate** (`requiredChecklistComplete`) +
  per-item toggling + manager-review progress. **Multi-assignee:** `assigneeIds[]`
  replaces single `assignedEmployeeId` (kept as a synced primary mirror for
  rules/stats/back-compat); assign one/many/whole-team; `assigneeIds arrayContains`
  query + rules. **Redesigned** task cards (avatars · name/role · checklist
  progress · glass), admin Home (4 KPIs + nav + **Analytics** page), branch cards
  (manager + employee count), and avatar-led admin user cards with search/filters.
  **Avatar bug fixed** via reusable `UserAvatar`/`AvatarStack` (initials fallback,
  no broken icons). New shared widgets `app_motion.dart` (`EntranceFade`),
  `app_search_field.dart`, `user_avatar.dart`. Schedule polished (coverage,
  shift badges, avatar chips — no logic change). `flutter analyze` clean (2
  pre-existing infos); 7 new unit tests pass.
- **Phase 10 — Production Hardening & QA (branch `claude/upbeat-knuth-7ch3wu`)**
  — verification + stabilization + UI modernization (no new business modules; no
  architecture change). **Cleanup:** deleted the dead Phase 2 `shift` feature
  (folder + 3 routes + DI + `shiftsForRole` + `shiftsCollection` + `shifts/{id}`
  rules), verified by `flutter analyze`. **Dashboards modernized** into a
  command-center layout: Manager Home now leads with a "Needs attention" hero row
  (waiting reviews · active tasks, tappable to the task screen) then grouped
  Team/Shifts and Tasks sections; Employee Home leads with a premium glass
  "Today's shift" card then a focused "Your tasks" grid. **Loading states:**
  list screens (tasks · admin users · branches) now use a `ListSkeleton`
  shimmer instead of a bare spinner. New shared widgets `dashboard_section.dart`
  (`SectionHeader`, `HeroStatCard`) and `list_skeleton.dart`. **Audited** (by code
  + tooling): auth/approval/role guards, task & schedule workflows, analytics
  math, realtime/offline, error handling, and the **profile-upload** path (timeouts
  + progress + error recovery — no freeze). `flutter analyze` clean (2 pre-existing
  infos); 7 unit tests pass; `build_runner` consistent (0 stale outputs).
- **Operations Workflow Upgrade (2026-06-18, branch `redesign`)** — enterprise task system on top of the existing architecture (no logic/routing/data/rules regressions). New entities: `RecurrenceConfig` (freezed, `nextOccurrence()`) and `ActivityEntry` (freezed). New enum `RecurrenceFrequency` (none/daily/weekly/monthly). `TaskModel` updated: `recurrence` and `activityLog` serialised to/from Firestore. `TaskCubit` extended: `createTask` seeds first `ActivityEntry`; `startTask`/`submitForReview`/`approveTask`/`rejectTask` each append an entry; `approveTask` calls `_spawnNextRecurrence` when `frequency != none`. New full-screen `TaskDetailsScreen` (all roles: status pills, assignees, checklist, notes/proof, activity timeline, role-appropriate actions). `MyTasksScreen` rebuilt (tabbed Active/Done, 5 sections, animated entrance, minimal cards → Details). `ManagerTasksView` taps open `TaskDetailsScreen` with slide transition. `_RecurrencePicker` chip row in task form (new tasks only). `flutter analyze` clean (0 errors, 0 warnings; 2 pre-existing infos in auth/profile cubits untouched).
- **Inline checklist editor + form simplification (2026-06-18, branch `redesign`)** — `_InlineChecklistEditor` + `_ChecklistItemRow` added to `task_action_sheets.dart`. Create Task form: "Add step" button builds a live list of steps with required/optional toggle (star) and × remove. Edit Task: seeds from existing `checklist`, preserves `completed`/`completedAt` on merge. Template prefill: checklist pre-populated and editable (was read-only `_ChecklistPreview` before, now removed). "Type: daily/special" dropdown removed from form (replaced by auto-inference from recurrence). `flutter analyze` clean.
- **Action needed:** deploy `firestore.rules` / `storage.rules` and
  enable Firebase Storage; bootstrap the first admin (set
  `role/approvalStatus/isActive` in the console) before production.

Defined in [route_names.dart](lib/core/routes/route_names.dart) /
[app_router.dart](lib/core/routes/app_router.dart). Navigation is auth-guarded,
**approval-gated**, **and role-guarded**: an authenticated-but-unapproved user
(`!user.hasAppAccess`) is held on `/pending-approval`; once approved each user is
dispatched to their role shell (`RouteNames.homeForRole`), and attempts to enter
another role's area (incl. manual URL hacking) are bounced back to their own
home. `/profile` & `/settings` are shared across all roles. The unauthenticated
landing is **Login** (the social Welcome page was removed).

## Backend / Firebase status

- **Firebase Auth** — configured & working: Email/Password, Phone, Google.
- **Cloud Firestore** — in use. **Offline persistence enabled** (stabilization):
  `Settings(persistenceEnabled: true, cacheSizeBytes: CACHE_SIZE_UNLIMITED)` set
  in `main.dart` — cached reads, writes queued + synced on reconnect, no crashes
  when the connection drops. The Pending Approval screen uses a **real-time**
  `users/{uid}` listener (`AuthCubit.watchCurrentUser`) instead of polling.
- **Firebase Storage** — code uploads to `users/{uid}/avatar.jpg` &
  `cover.jpg`. ⚠️ **Storage must be enabled** in the Firebase console for
  uploads to work in production.
- **Security rules** — ✅ **In the repo:** [`firestore.rules`](firestore.rules)
  and [`storage.rules`](storage.rules), wired into [`firebase.json`](firebase.json).
  Firestore rules encode the role/branch + **approval** access model: **self
  registration** is allowed only as a `pending`, **inactive** employee;
  **admin** reads/writes any user (approve/reject, promotions, branch moves,
  (de)activation) — **account approval is admin-only (Phase 6)**; **any branch
  member** (manager **or** employee) **reads** users in their **own branch** —
  managers see their team, employees see the coworkers on their shift + their
  manager for the weekly schedule (stabilization fix; `selfBranch() != '' &&
  branchId == selfBranch()`) but only an **admin** writes user docs; **employee**
  edits only their own doc and may **not** change
  the privileged fields (`role`, `branchId`, `isActive`, `assignedShift`,
  `approvalStatus`) — non-privileged fields (profile, `fcmToken`) are allowed. **`shifts/{shiftId}` (Phase 2)** is the
  first branch-scoped collection wired to `canReachBranch()`: admin = all
  branches, manager = own branch, employee = their own assigned shift
  (read-only). **`tasks/{taskId}` (Phase 3–4)** follows the same model with a
  **limited employee self-update** — the assignee may advance status / add notes /
  proof, but not reassign, move branch, set approved/rejected, or forge the
  review-attribution fields (`approvedBy`/`rejectedBy`). **Storage** (`storage.rules`)
  now also allows task proof images at `tasks/{taskId}/proof.jpg` (any signed-in
  user read/write; the meaningful gate is the Firestore `proofImageUrl` write).
  **`branches/{branchId}` (Phase 5)** is admin-write / any-signed-in-read with
  hard delete denied (soft delete only); admin user-administration uses the
  existing `users` admin-update rule. **`weekly_schedules/{id}` (Phase 7)** is
  branch-scoped: admin/own-branch manager write, and **any employee of the
  branch** reads (their schedule + today's team) via `branchId == selfBranch()`.
  **`shift_swaps/{id}` (Phase 7)**: read/act = the two involved employees + the
  branch manager/admin; create requires the requester to be self and the swap to
  be in their own branch (the exact status flow is validated client-side in
  `ShiftSwapCubit`). **`task_templates/{id}` (Stabilization)**: read = any
  admin/manager; create = admin (global/any) or own-branch manager;
  update/delete = admin or the owning-branch manager (employees don't read
  templates). Reusable `isAdmin()` / `isManager()` / `canReachBranch()`
  helpers remain for future collections. ⚠️ Still need to be **deployed**
  (`firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage`).

### Firestore schema — `users/{uid}`

Shared by the auth (`UserModel`) and profile (`ProfileModel`) layers.

| Field                                                   | Type      | Notes                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------- | ------------------------------ |
| `uid`, `email`, `authProvider`                         | string    | core identity                  |
| `role`                                                 | string    | **Phase 1** — `admin` (global) / `manager` (one branch) / `employee` (own data); seeded `employee` once, role-guarded |
| `branchId`                                             | string?   | **Phase 1** — owning branch. **admin:** null/ignored (global); **manager:** their one branch; **employee:** their branch. Assigned by an admin. |
| `assignedShift`                                        | string?   | **Phase 1/2** — references the assigned `shifts/{shiftId}`; null until a manager assigns one |
| `isActive`                                             | bool      | **Phase 1** — activation/soft-disable. **New sign-ups seeded `false`** (pending approval); set `true` on approval |
| `approvalStatus`                                       | string    | **Approval** — `pending` / `approved` / `rejected`. New sign-ups seeded `pending`; missing → treated as `approved` (legacy). **Flipped by admin only (Phase 6)** |
| `fcmToken`, `fcmTokenUpdatedAt`                        | string? / Timestamp? | **Phase 6** — device push token (self-written, best-effort) |
| `displayName`, `photoUrl`                              | string    | **legacy** auth keys, kept in sync |
| `fullName`, `username`, `profileImage`, `coverImage`   | string    | profile identity               |
| `phoneNumber`, `bio`, `gender`, `country`, `city`, `website` | string?  | personal                       |
| `birthDate`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `lastSeen`      | Timestamp | dates                          |
| `isEmailVerified`, `isVerified`, `isOnline`            | bool      | status/presence                |
| `isProfilePublic`, `allowMessages`, `allowNotifications` | bool    | privacy (default true)         |
| `accountStatus`                                        | string    | default `active`               |
| `followersCount`, `followingCount`, `postsCount`, `likesCount` | int | **legacy/unused** — FBRO is not a social app |

> **Privileged-field seeding:** `role`/`branchId`/`isActive`/`assignedShift`/
> `approvalStatus` are seeded **once** on first document creation (a new account
> is seeded as a `pending`, **inactive** employee) and are deliberately excluded
> from `UserModel.toMap()`, so a routine re-login (which merges) can never reset
> an admin-assigned role/branch or re-pend an approved account.

### Firestore schema — `branches/{branchId}` (Phase 5)

| Field        | Type       | Notes                                              |
| ------------ | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`         | string     | mirrors the doc id                                 |
| `name`       | string     | branch name                                        |
| `location`   | string?    | optional area / address                            |
| `isActive`   | bool       | activate / deactivate                              |
| `deletedAt`  | Timestamp? | soft-delete marker (null = live; excluded from list)|
| `createdAt`, `updatedAt` | Timestamp | server timestamps                      |

> Admin-only writes; any signed-in user may read (branch names show in pickers).
> Managers/employees belong to a branch via `users/{uid}.branchId` (single source
> of truth for assignment).

### Firestore schema — `shifts/{shiftId}` (Phase 2 — REMOVED in Phase 10)

The `shifts` collection, its rules, and the whole `shift` feature were deleted in
Phase 10 (dead code, never consumed). The **weekly schedule**
(`weekly_schedules`) is the production roster. `users/{uid}.assignedShift` and
`tasks.assignedShiftId` remain as nullable strings (unused).

### Firestore schema — `tasks/{taskId}` (Phase 3, +Phase 9 multi-assignee)

| Field                | Type       | Notes                                                  |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`                 | string     | mirrors the doc id (set on create)                    |
| `title`              | string     | task title                                            |
| `description`        | string?    | details                                               |
| `type`               | string     | `daily` / `special`                                   |
| `status`             | string     | `pending`→`started`→`completed`→`waitingReview`→`approved`/`rejected` |
| `priority`           | string     | `low` / `normal` / `high`                             |
| `branchId`           | string?    | owning branch (admin: any · manager: own branch)      |
| `assigneeIds`        | string[]   | **Phase 9** — employees assigned to the task (multi-assignee). Empty = unassigned |
| `assignedEmployeeId` | string?    | **legacy mirror** of the primary assignee (`assigneeIds.first`), kept in sync for back-compat rules/stats; read falls back to it when `assigneeIds` is absent |
| `checklist`          | array<map> | **Phase 9** — `{id, title, isRequired, completed, completedAt}` items generated from the template; the task can't complete until all required items are `completed` |
| `recurrence`         | map?       | **Workflow Upgrade** — `{frequency, interval, weekday, hour, minute}`. `frequency` = `none`/`daily`/`weekly`/`monthly`. When a task is approved and `frequency != none`, `TaskCubit._spawnNextRecurrence` auto-creates the next instance (checklist reset, deadline advanced) |
| `activityLog`        | array<map> | **Workflow Upgrade** — embedded array of `{status, actorId, actorName, at, note}`. Every status transition appends an entry. Shown newest-first on the Task Details screen |
| `createdBy`          | string?    | uid of the manager/admin who created it               |
| `assignedShiftId`    | string?    | optional link to `shifts/{shiftId}`                   |
| `deadline`           | Timestamp? | due date/time                                         |
| `notes`              | string?    | employee's free-text notes                            |
| `proofImageUrl`      | string?    | proof image download URL (uploaded on completion)     |
| `startedAt`  | Timestamp? | set atomically when `startTask` writes `status=started` |
| `submittedAt` | Timestamp? | set atomically when `submitForReview` / `completeAndSubmit` writes `status=waitingReview` |
| `approvedBy`, `approvedAt`   | string? / Timestamp? | reviewer uid + time on approve (Phase 4 audit) |
| `rejectedBy`, `rejectedAt`   | string? / Timestamp? | reviewer uid + time on reject (Phase 4 audit) |
| `reviewNotes`        | string?    | reviewer's note on approve/reject (Phase 4)           |
| `createdAt`, `updatedAt` | Timestamp | server timestamps written by the datasource       |

> Workflow: manager/admin creates (optionally with recurrence + checklist) + assigns → employee `started`→`completed`→`waitingReview` → manager/admin `approved`/`rejected` (approval auto-spawns next recurrence). Branch/role access + the limited employee self-update are enforced by `firestore.rules` (`tasks/{taskId}`). The employee cannot reassign, change branch, or set the terminal approved/rejected status.

### Firestore schema — `task_templates/{id}` (Stabilization)

Reusable task blueprints. A template carries only task *content* — never an
assignment or status (those are set when a task is created from it).

| Field         | Type       | Notes                                                       |
| ------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`          | string     | mirrors the doc id (set on create)                         |
| `title`       | string     | template title (e.g. `Open Shop`)                          |
| `description` | string?    | optional details                                           |
| `type`        | string     | `daily` / `special`                                        |
| `priority`    | string     | `low` / `normal` / `high`                                  |
| `checklistItems` | array<map> | **Phase 9** — reusable checklist: `{id, title, isRequired}` per step (e.g. Unlock entrance · Turn on lights). Generated into a task's `checklist` on create |
| `branchId`    | string?    | owning branch; `''`/null = **global** (admin-made, all branches) |
| `createdBy`   | string?    | uid of the manager/admin who created it                    |
| `createdAt`, `updatedAt` | Timestamp | server timestamps                              |

> Branch/role access is enforced by `firestore.rules` (`task_templates/{id}`):
> read = any admin/manager; create = admin (global/any) or own-branch manager;
> update/delete = admin or the owning-branch manager. Employees don't read
> templates. Branch filtering (global + own branch) is applied client-side in
> `TaskCubit.templates` (the collection is tiny).

### Firestore schema — `weekly_schedules/{id}` (Phase 7)

One document per (branch, week). Deterministic id `<branchId>_<yyyy-MM-dd>` (the
week's Sunday), so a week is addressed directly without a query.

| Field         | Type       | Notes                                                       |
| ------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`          | string     | mirrors the doc id                                         |
| `branchId`    | string     | owning branch                                              |
| `weekStart`   | Timestamp  | Sunday 00:00 that starts the week                          |
| `assignments` | map        | `{ <day>: { <shift>: [uid, …] } }` — `day` = `sunday`…`saturday`, `shift` = `morning`/`night` |
| `createdBy`   | string?    | uid of the manager/admin who created it                    |
| `createdAt`, `updatedAt` | Timestamp | server timestamps; assign/remove use nested `arrayUnion`/`arrayRemove` |

> The roster is intentionally a nested map so an employee can appear on any mix
> of morning/night slots across the week. Branch/role access is enforced by
> `firestore.rules` (`weekly_schedules/{id}`): admin all · own-branch manager
> write · branch employees read.

### Firestore schema — `shift_swaps/{id}` (Phase 7)

| Field          | Type       | Notes                                                       |
| -------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`           | string     | mirrors the doc id (set on create)                         |

## Known gaps & follow-ups

- ⚠️ **Enable Firebase Storage** and **deploy** the committed
  `firestore.rules` / `storage.rules` before production.
- **Approval & user administration are now in-app (Phase 5)** — admins approve/
  reject users, (de)activate, change role/branch, assign managers to branches and
  move employees between branches from the admin module. The **first admin** must
  still be bootstrapped in the Firebase console (set `role: admin`,
  `approvalStatus: approved`, `isActive: true`), since every sign-up — including
  the founder's — is seeded `pending`/inactive.
- **Managers are promoted, not created** — there is no admin "create account"
  flow: client-side Firebase Auth account creation would sign the admin out, and
  there are no Cloud Functions (no Node.js). "Add Manager" promotes an existing
  approved employee to `role: manager`; new staff self-register, then an admin
  approves them (optionally directly as a manager).
- **Approval is admin-only (Phase 6)** — managers no longer approve or write user
  accounts (rules + UI); they manage branch operations (shifts/tasks) only.
- **Push notifications need a sender** — the FCM **client** foundation is in
  place (permission, `users/{uid}.fcmToken`, foreground snackbars), but actually
  **emitting** the events (task assigned, waiting review, new registration, …)
  requires a server trigger. With no Node.js/Cloud Functions in scope, a sender
  (Cloud Function or external) is the remaining piece. FCM also needs native
  setup: **APNs key + Push capability (iOS)**; Android works via `google-services`.
  `NotificationType` documents the event contract for whatever sends them.
- **Employee home dashboard** (`EmployeeHomeScreen`) is a **full live
  command center (redesign v2, 2026-06-18)** — animated progress-ring hero +
  today's shift, count-up stat strip, and an **actionable** task list (start a
  task inline, continue, view feedback) computed from the live `TaskCubit`
  stream; the Tasks tab is the full list. The **Manager** home
  (`ManagerHomeScreen`) leads with a "Needs attention" hero + grouped sections;
  the **Admin** shell is the full admin module (Phase 5).
- ~~Orphaned Phase 2 shift placeholders~~ **REMOVED (Phase 10).** The entire
  `shift` feature (`features/shift/`, the 3 placeholder screens + routes,
  `RouteNames.shiftsForRole`, `AppDependencies.shiftRepository`,
  `AppConstants.shiftsCollection`, and the `shifts/{shiftId}` rules) was deleted
  as verified dead code. The shift-visibility requirement is fully met by the
  Weekly Schedule (employee My Week · manager branch schedule · admin all branches).
- **Real-time scope: tasks + approval are push; everything else is reload-after-mutation.**
  **Tasks are fully streamed** (`TaskRepository.watch*` → `TaskCubit`): an
  assigned task or any status change appears on every open client immediately
  (cross-client push), backed by the offline cache. Pending-approval is also
  stream-driven (`watchCurrentUser`). **Schedule / branch / admin / swap** lists
  still use **reload-after-mutation** (instant for the acting user) +
  pull-to-refresh; another user's open list reflects a change on next refresh.
  **(Phase 8)** approving a swap auto-refreshes the manager Schedule tab via a
  `BlocListener`.
- **Integration-audit findings.** (1) **Managers do not approve users** —
  approval is admin-only (Phase 6 design); any "manager approves employee"
  expectation is intentionally unsupported. (2) **Rejected users** land on the
  generic "Pending Approval" screen — access is correctly blocked, but the copy
  doesn't distinguish *rejected* from *pending*. (3) ~~Admin task creation uses a
  free-text branch field~~ **FIXED (Stabilization)** — admin now selects from a
  Firestore-backed branch dropdown, so a task's `branchId` always matches a real
  branch and the Assign picker is populated.
- **Shift-swap status flow is validated client-side** (`ShiftSwapCubit`), like the
  task transitions — `firestore.rules` enforce *who* may write a swap, not the
  exact order. Hardening the transition matrix server-side is a follow-up.
- **Task workflow is live** (Phase 4) but a few deliberate simplifications remain:
  - **Status transitions are validated client-side** (`TaskCubit._canTransition`),
    not in `firestore.rules` — the rules enforce *who* can write, not the exact
    flow order. Hardening the transition matrix server-side is a follow-up.
  - ~~Assignee uid → name isn't resolved on the card~~ **DONE (Phase 9)** — the
    `TaskCubit` resolves a per-branch user **directory** so cards show real
    avatars · names · roles (multi-assignee shown as an avatar stack + count).
  - `assignTask` writes the task side only — **`users/{uid}.assignedShift` is not
    auto-synced**, and there's no status automation. Storage proof write is
    loosely gated (see security rules).
  - **Notifications and analytics are intentionally out of scope.**
- **Account deletion** removes the Firebase Auth account but **not** the
  `users/{uid}` Firestore document — that cleanup belongs in a Cloud Function
  (`auth.user().onDelete`); see note in
  [auth_cubit.dart](lib/features/auth/presentation/cubit/auth_cubit.dart).
- **Light theme** exists in `AppTheme.light` but is **not wired up** — app is
  hardcoded to dark mode in [main.dart](lib/main.dart).
- **Legacy social fields** (`followersCount`/`followingCount`/`postsCount`/
  `likesCount` on `ProfileEntity`) are unused and should be removed in a future
  cleanup — FBRO is a role-based operations app, not a social network.

## Testing

- **Unit/widget tests (35 passing):** `test/task_checklist_test.dart` (checklist
  completion rule, multi-assignee (de)serialization + legacy fallback,
  template→task checklist), `test/employee_metrics_test.dart` (per-employee
  performance derivation — completed/pending/rate/late, multi-assignee, deadline
  lateness), `test/swap_eligibility_test.dart` (the future-shifts-only swap rule —
  slot-start derivation + 8 boundary cases),
  `test/pending_actions_widget_test.dart` (renders the Admin Pending Actions panel
  headlessly — rows, tap callbacks, all-clear state),
  `test/schedule_helpers_test.dart` (name resolution + orphan/broken-reference
  detection), `test/user_model_test.dart` (malformed-doc hardening),
  `test/app_search_field_test.dart` and `test/task_card_layout_test.dart`
  (layout regressions). `test/widget_test.dart` remains an empty placeholder.
  Cubit/router tests are still a gap (see suggested next steps).
- **Manual QA:** [`QA_CHECKLIST.md`](QA_CHECKLIST.md) — an executable, on-device
  checklist covering the Employee / Manager / Admin workflows, real-time, offline,
  and UI/branding, with the deploy/Storage preconditions a tester must do first.

## Suggested next steps

1. **Deploy rules + enable Storage** — `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage` and enable Firebase Storage in the console. Until then proof uploads return `unauthorized`.
2. **Bootstrap first admin** — in the Firebase console set `role: admin`, `approvalStatus: approved`, `isActive: true` on the founder's account; then verify register → Pending Approval → approve → role dispatch end to end.
3. **Firestore rules for `activityLog`/`recurrence`** — the new fields written by `TaskCubit` are covered by the existing employee self-update path. Confirm the limited-employee rule allows writing `activityLog` (array union) without allowing `recurrence` changes. Harden if needed.
4. **Recurring tasks: server-side spawn** — the current `_spawnNextRecurrence` runs client-side on approve. A Cloud Function on `tasks/{taskId}` write (status==approved + frequency!=none) would be more reliable for offline/concurrent approval cases.
5. **Notifications sender** — add a server trigger for the `NotificationType` events (task assigned, waiting review, approved/rejected) to device tokens (Cloud Function or external) + native FCM setup (APNs key + Push capability on iOS).
6. **Task workflow hardening** — enforce status transitions in `firestore.rules` (who can write each status value), not only client-side in `TaskCubit._canTransition`.
7. **Stats optimization** (if data grows) — move dashboard counts to Firestore `count()` aggregate queries with composite indexes.
8. Add a Cloud Function to clean up `users/{uid}` Firestore document on account deletion.
9. Add cubit/widget tests, starting with `TaskCubit` transition rules, `RecurrenceConfig.nextOccurrence`, `ActivityEntry` serialisation, and the router redirect.
