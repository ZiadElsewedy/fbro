/// A one-way announcement in the Communications Center. A manager or admin
/// "sends" a broadcast to every branch ([BroadcastAudience.allBranches],
/// admin-only), a single branch ([BroadcastAudience.branch]), or one individual
/// ([BroadcastAudience.user], Phase 2); recipients read it and receive a push
/// notification. Persisted at `broadcasts/{id}` **by the `sendBroadcast` Cloud
/// Function** (the authoritative write — clients don't write the doc directly).
///
/// Access is enforced server-side in `firestore.rules`: admin reads all, branch
/// members read their branch's broadcasts plus all-branches ones, and the
/// individual recipient reads their own direct message. The queryable targeting
/// field for the branch/all feed is [branchId] (`null`/empty == all branches);
/// an individual message instead carries [targetUserId].
