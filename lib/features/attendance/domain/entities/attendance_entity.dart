/// One employee's attendance for **one shift on one day** — the record behind a
/// clock-in/out. Stored at `attendance/{uid}_{yyyyMMdd}_{shift}` (a deterministic
/// id — see [attendanceDocId] — which is what makes clock-in idempotent and
/// offline-safe). The append-only audit trail lives in the `events` subcollection
/// (`AttendanceEvent`).
///
/// The five minute totals ([workedMinutes] … [breakMinutes]) are a **snapshot**
/// written at clock-out / auto-close by `AttendanceCalculator` (the single source
/// of that math), so reports and the admin dashboard aggregate plain numbers
/// without re-deriving per document. While a session is in progress the live
/// timer recomputes them from the calculator against `now` instead of reading the
/// stale snapshot.
///
/// Lateness / early-leave / overtime are **derived** ([isLate] / [hasEarlyLeave]
/// / [hasOvertime]) from those minute fields — they are deliberately not extra
/// statuses (see [AttendanceStatus]).
