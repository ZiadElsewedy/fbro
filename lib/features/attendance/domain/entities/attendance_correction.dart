/// An **attendance correction request** — the one honest way a *settled* record
/// changes. An employee disputes/fixes their own record (a missing clock-out, a
/// wrong time, an absence recorded in error); a manager/admin approves or rejects.
/// Stored at `attendance_corrections/{id}` (auto id).
///
/// It is a first-class approval object with a `Pending → Approved / Rejected`
/// lifecycle, reusing [RequestStatus] so corrections and operations requests
/// share one decision vocabulary. It deliberately mirrors the `requests/` slice.
///
/// **Server-authoritative apply:** the client only writes this doc (file a
/// correction; a reviewer stamps the decision). On approval the
/// `onAttendanceCorrectionWritten` Cloud Function copies [resolution] onto the
/// parent `attendance/{attendanceId}` record and appends the immutable
/// `correctionApproved` audit event — clients never touch the record or the audit
/// trail directly. The [resolution] itself is computed once, on approval, by
/// `DecideCorrection` through `AttendanceCalculator` (the single source of the
/// minute math), so nothing is recomputed server-side.
