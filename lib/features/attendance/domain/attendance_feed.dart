/// A snapshot of a user's attendance history **plus its Firestore sync state**.

/// The clock surface is driven optimistically off Firestore's offline cache: a
/// clock-in/out completes immediately from a local write and syncs to the backend
/// in the background (where the Cloud Functions then derive the audit trail). This
/// carries the snapshot's metadata so the cubit can surface an honest
/// **offline** / **syncing** hint without a second listener or a custom sync queue:
///   * [isOffline] — the snapshot was served purely from cache (no server round-trip
///     yet), i.e. the device is offline.
///   * [hasPendingWrites] — a local write hasn't been acknowledged by the backend
///     yet (the "syncing…" state).
