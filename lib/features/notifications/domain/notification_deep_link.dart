/// there is no safe destination for this recipient (e.g. an employee tapping a
/// broadcast they can't open, or an unresolved/unknown route). A `null` is a
/// deliberate guarded no-op — the caller falls back safely (stay on the inbox
/// / open the inbox), so **navigation never crashes**.

/// map (typed values) and for an FCM `RemoteMessage.data` map (all-strings),
/// since ids are coerced to a non-empty `String?`. When a specific target id is
/// missing but a safe list destination exists (cases / requests), the resolver
/// falls back to the list rather than returning `null`, so the tap is never
