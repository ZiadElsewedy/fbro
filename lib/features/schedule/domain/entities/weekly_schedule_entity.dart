/// A branch's weekly shift schedule (Phase 7) — the in-app replacement for the
/// Excel / WhatsApp roster. One document per (branch, week): the [weekStart] is
/// the Sunday at 00:00 that begins the week.
///
/// The roster is a nested map — `day → shift → [employee uids]` — so the same
/// employee can appear on any mix of morning / night slots across the week
/// (3 mornings, 3 nights, mixed, …). A manager owns their branch's schedule; an
/// admin can edit any. Access is enforced server-side in `firestore.rules`
/// (`weekly_schedules/{id}`): admin = all branches · manager = own branch ·
/// employee = read-only on their own branch.
