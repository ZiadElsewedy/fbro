/// A shift-swap request (Phase 7, exchange model). The [requesterId] employee
/// asks the [targetId] coworker on the **opposite shift that same day** to
/// **trade** shifts — the requester holds (week, [day], [shift]); the target
/// holds the opposite shift (there are only two). The coworker approves first,
/// then the branch manager; on manager approval the `approveSwap` Cloud Function
/// **exchanges both slots atomically** (Ziad's Night ⇄ Ahmed's Morning) — the
/// requester moves to the opposite shift and the target takes the requester's.
/// No new field is needed: the target's slot is always [shift]`.opposite`.
///
/// Names are denormalized ([requesterName] / [targetName]) so the request can be
/// displayed without extra user lookups. Access is enforced server-side in
/// `firestore.rules` (`shift_swaps/{id}`): the two employees and the branch
/// manager/admin can see and act on it; the final `managerApproved` transition is
/// owned by the Cloud Function.
