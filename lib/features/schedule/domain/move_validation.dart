/// move/swap flows. Returns `null` when the edit is legal or a **user-facing

///
/// Scope note (settled product rulings):
///   - Double-booking is the one hard conflict the one-slot-per-shift model
///     can express — it is **blocked**, matching the insight strip's red cue.
///   - Position compatibility applies only to an **exchange** (someone replaces
///     someone) and only when the branch's [SwapPolicy] restricts it — the same
///     policy already governing employee-initiated swaps, so manager edits and
///     employee swaps can never disagree about what "compatible" means.
///   - There is **no staffing quota**: emptying a shift is information for the
///     manager's judgment (see [wouldEmptySlot] — a confirm, not a block),
///     consistent with the facts-not-quotas insight design.
