/// A swap may only be requested for an **upcoming** shift — a past or already
/// in-progress shift can't be swapped. This is the single source of truth for
/// that rule, enforced in three layers: the request bottom sheet (immediate
/// feedback), [ShiftSwapCubit.requestSwap] (the authoritative client gate), and
/// `firestore.rules` (server backstop — see `swapSlotInFuture`).
///
/// A slot is addressed by (week, [ScheduleDay], [ScheduleShift]); its concrete
/// start instant is derived from the week's Sunday plus the day offset and the
/// **standing** shift start from [ShiftHours.standard] — so the swap gate tracks
/// the schedule's single source of truth (weekday night 15:00, weekend night
/// 16:00), never a hardcoded time. Per-week start overrides aren't reflected
/// here by design; this is a coarse "is the slot still in the future" gate.
