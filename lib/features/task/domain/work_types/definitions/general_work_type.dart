/// optional description, an optional checklist, always reviewed, no extra

/// task with a missing / unknown / rolled-back `workType` resolves here and
/// behaves exactly as tasks do now (zero-migration back-compat).
///
/// It overrides nothing — every behaviour comes from [BaseWorkType]. That it can
/// be this small is the point: the general case *is* the default, and
/// specialised types pay only for what they change.
