/// The behaviour contract for **one kind of operational work** (the Strategy).
///
/// Every work type owns its own fields, milestones *and* rules here, so screens
/// never branch on the type — they ask the definition. Adding a completely new
/// kind of work is a new subclass + one line in [WorkTypeRegistry]: there is
/// **no `switch` anywhere** a new type has to force-edit, which is how
/// Open/Closed emerges from the architecture rather than being bolted on.
///
/// Flutter-free by design (mirrors the `RequestType` convention): icons and
/// widgets live in presentation (`work_type_presenter.dart`), keyed by [id], so
/// this contract and every definition stay trivially unit-testable.
///
/// **Concerns this contract owns** (the ones that genuinely differ per type):
/// dynamic [fields], [timeline] milestones, [validateSetup] / [validateSubmission]
/// gates, [progress], [reviewDisposition], proof requirement, [summarize] and
/// [analytics].
///
/// **Concerns it deliberately does *not* own:** *permissions* stay with
/// `task_access.dart` + the deployed `firestore.rules` (a per-type override
/// would risk diverging from the server-side security gate), and the *coarse
/// status machine* stays generic. Both have a clean seam to extend; we don't add
/// hooks with no consumer.
