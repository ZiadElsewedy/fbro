/// the current shift/day rather than the employee's entire history.
///
/// **Included**
///  - non-terminal work always (pending · started · waitingReview · completed);
///  - rejected / rework — still outstanding, regardless of age;
///  - approved **only when approved today** (the employee still sees credit for
///    work they finished this shift).

/// **Excluded**
///  - approved tasks from a previous day — historical / effectively archived.
