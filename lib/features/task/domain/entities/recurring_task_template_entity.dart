/// A permanent blueprint for a **shift-assigned** task that repeats on its own
/// clock (Shift Assignment feature) — e.g. "Open Store" every day on the
/// Morning shift. Distinct from [TaskTemplateEntity], which is a one-shot
/// checklist blueprint a manager instantiates by hand; this one is read by the
/// `generateShiftTaskInstances` Cloud Function, which creates one real
/// `tasks/{id}` document per due date (so completion is trackable per day) and
/// links it back here via `TaskEntity.sourceTemplateId`.
///
/// Always branch-scoped (a shift only means something within one branch's
/// roster) and always [TaskAssignmentType.shift] — there is no
/// individual/team recurring-template path (existing per-task `RecurrenceConfig`
/// already covers that case).
