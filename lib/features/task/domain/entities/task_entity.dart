/// A unit of work in DROP (Phase 3) — the core operations workflow: a
/// manager/admin creates and assigns a task, one or more employees execute it
/// (start → complete, with optional notes + proof image), and a manager/admin
/// reviews it (approve / reject).
///
/// A task is branch-scoped via [branchId] and may be tied to an
/// [assignedShiftId]. It supports **multiple assignees** ([assigneeIds], Phase 9
/// — replaces the former single `assignedEmployeeId`) and an optional
/// **[checklist]** generated from a checklist template. Access is enforced
/// server-side in `firestore.rules` (admin: all branches · manager: own branch ·
/// employee: tasks they're assigned to).
