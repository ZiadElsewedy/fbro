/// Admin task screen (Phase 4, redesigned). A **branch-based overview** — the
/// admin sees every branch with its operational vitals (Active / Pending Review
/// / Overdue / Completion Rate) and drills into a branch for the full task list
/// (create / assign / edit / review / delete). Replaces the former flat
/// all-branches list, which didn't scale. Backed by `TaskCubit`.
