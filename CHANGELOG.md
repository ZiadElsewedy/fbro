# Changelog

All notable changes to **FBRO** are recorded here. After every completed
feature, append a short summary of what was **added / removed / fixed /
refactored**. See [PROJECT_CONTEXT.md](PROJECT_CONTEXT.md) for architecture.

The project adheres loosely to [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com)
and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

---

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` — architecture, dependency maps, modification map, and
  conventions as the single source of truth for the codebase.
- `CURRENT_STATE.md` — live project status: module status, working tree, routes,
  Firebase/Firestore/Storage status & schema, known gaps, and next steps.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — this file.
- Documentation protocol: PROJECT_CONTEXT.md, CURRENT_STATE.md, and CHANGELOG.md
  are treated as production source and must be verified/synchronized before any
  task completes (verification rules + self-check in PROJECT_CONTEXT §5). Docs
  are updated automatically — never ask whether to update.
- `.claude/settings.json` — committed `SessionStart` hook that injects the
  documentation protocol into every new session (read all three docs first,
  verify against the codebase, auto-update docs + any stale project memory
  before finishing).

## 2026-06-15 — Rebrand to DROP

Replaces the **FBRO** visual identity with **DROP** across the app.

### Added
- `DropLogo` ([drop_logo.dart](lib/core/widgets/drop_logo.dart)) — renders the
  **DROP wordmark artwork** at `assets/drop_logo.png` (the brand's "DROP" + down
  arrow). The PNG is transparent-background with white-filled glyphs; `DropLogo`
  tints it to the theme color (white) via `BlendMode.srcIn` so it stays crisp on
  the near-black UI, sized by `height`.
- `assets/drop_logo.png` registered in `pubspec.yaml` (`flutter: assets:`).
- The logo now appears on the **splash / loading screen**, **Login** and
  **Register** headers, and the **Pending Approval** screen.

### Changed / Removed
- Removed `FbroLogo` (`fbro_logo.dart`) and all its usages.
- App display name → **DROP** (`MaterialApp.title`, `AppConstants.appName`).

### Notes
- This is a **visual** rebrand. The Dart package name (`fbro`, `package:fbro/…`)
  and the iOS bundle id (`com.example.fbro`) are unchanged — renaming those is a
  separate, higher-risk refactor (every import + native config) and is not
  required for the user-facing brand.
- The logo is tinted **white** for the dark-only UI; if a light theme is wired up
  later, the tint should adapt (or ship a dark-on-light variant).

## 2026-06-15 — Phase 4: Task Workflow & Review System

Activates the Phase 3 task foundation into the **real operations workflow** —
managers/admins create + assign, employees execute, managers/admins review — with
a `TaskCubit`, functional role screens, proof images, audit fields and
status-transition rules. Reuses the existing architecture; no foundations rewritten.

### Added
- **`TaskCubit` + `TaskState`** ([cubit](lib/features/task/presentation/cubit/task_cubit.dart))
  driving the workflow for all three roles (loads by role; keeps the list visible
  during mutations; surfaces errors as snackbars). Provided app-wide in
  [main.dart](lib/main.dart).
- **10 task use cases** (`GetAllTasks`, `GetTasksByBranch`, `GetEmployeeTasks`,
  `CreateTask`, `UpdateTask`, `DeleteTask`, `AssignTask`, `ChangeTaskStatus`,
  `ReviewTask`, `UploadTaskProof`) + the auth `GetUsersByBranch` (assignee picker).
- **Functional screens** replacing the Phase 3 placeholders:
  - Employee **My Tasks** — start → complete (notes + optional **proof image**
    via `image_picker`) → submit for review; restart a rejected task.
  - Manager **Branch Tasks** / Admin **Task Management** (shared
    `ManagerTasksView`) — create, edit, **assign** (branch-employee picker),
    delete, and **review** (approve/reject + note).
  - Shared `TaskCard`, `task_action_sheets` (create/assign/review), and
    `TaskEmptyState` widgets.
- **Status-transition validation** in `TaskCubit._canTransition`
  (pending→started→completed→waitingReview→approved/rejected, plus rejected→started
  for redo); invalid moves are blocked with an error.
- **Review audit fields** on `TaskEntity`/`TaskModel`: `approvedBy`/`approvedAt`/
  `rejectedBy`/`rejectedAt`/`reviewNotes` (written together by `reviewTask`).
- **Proof image upload** to Firebase Storage `tasks/{taskId}/proof.jpg`
  (`TaskRepository.uploadProof`); `storage.rules` updated.
- `AuthRepository.getUsersByBranch` + `UserRemoteDataSource.getUsersByBranch`
  (branch employees for the assignee picker).

### Changed
- `TaskRepository` gained `reviewTask` + `uploadProof`; `TaskRemoteDataSourceImpl`
  now also takes `FirebaseStorage`.
- `firestore.rules` (`tasks/{taskId}`): the employee self-update now also forbids
  changing the review-attribution fields (`approvedBy`/`rejectedBy`).
- DI: `AppDependencies.taskCubit` added and wired.

### Notes
- Status-flow order is enforced **client-side** (`TaskCubit`); `firestore.rules`
  still enforce *who* may write. Hardening the transition matrix server-side,
  resolving assignee uid → name on cards, and `users.assignedShift` sync are
  follow-ups. **No notifications, no analytics** (out of scope).

---

## 2026-06-15 — Phase 3: Task Management foundation

Adds the **core FBRO workflow** foundation — managers create/assign tasks,
employees execute them, managers review them. Data + domain + rules + placeholder
UI only; **no task Cubit / use cases / workflow UI yet** (minimal & extensible).

### Added
- **Task enums** in `core/enums`: `TaskType` (daily/special), `TaskStatus`
  (pending→started→completed→waitingReview→approved/rejected) and `TaskPriority`
  (low/normal/high), each with safe `fromString` defaults.
- **`task` feature** with full data + domain layers:
  - `TaskEntity` ([task_entity.dart](lib/features/task/domain/entities/task_entity.dart),
    freezed): `id, title, description?, type, status, priority, branchId?,
    assignedEmployeeId?, createdBy?, assignedShiftId?, deadline?, notes?,
    proofImageUrl?, createdAt?, updatedAt?`.
  - `TaskModel` ([task_model.dart](lib/features/task/data/models/task_model.dart))
    — Firestore (de)serialization for `tasks/{taskId}`.
  - `TaskRepository` (+ `TaskRepositoryImpl`) and `TaskRemoteDataSource`
    (+ `Impl`): list (all / by branch / by employee), get, create, update,
    delete, `assignTask` (employee + optional shift) and `updateStatus`
    (workflow transitions). Datasource throws `ServerException` → `ServerFailure`.
- **Firestore rules** for `tasks/{taskId}` — branch model (admin all · manager
  own branch) **plus a limited employee self-update**: the assigned employee may
  advance status / add notes / proof on their own task but may not reassign,
  change branch/creator, or set the terminal approved/rejected status.
- **Three role placeholder screens** (`task_management_screen` [admin],
  `branch_tasks_screen` [manager], `my_tasks_screen` [employee]) at
  `/admin/tasks`, `/manager/tasks`, `/my-tasks`, reachable via a **Tasks icon**
  in the shared `RoleScaffold` (`RouteNames.tasksForRole`).
- `AppConstants.tasksCollection`; `AppDependencies.taskRepository` (DI wiring).

### Notes
- Admin/manager task routes reuse the existing `_isAdminArea` / `_isManagerArea`
  route guards; `/my-tasks` is self-scoped.
- Screens are functional placeholders only. Proof-image **upload to Storage** is
  not wired yet (`proofImageUrl` is a plain field); the workflow UI and
  `users.assignedShift` sync land in the next phase.
- **Notifications and analytics are intentionally not built** (out of scope).

## 2026-06-15 — Phase 2: Shift Management foundation

Adds the shift system foundation (data + domain + rules + placeholder UI) that
manager scheduling and, later, task management build on. Minimal and extensible
by design — **no shift Cubit / use cases / CRUD UI yet**.

### Added
- **`shift` feature** with full Clean-Architecture data + domain layers:
  - `ShiftEntity` ([shift_entity.dart](lib/features/shift/domain/entities/shift_entity.dart),
    freezed): `id`, `name`, `startTime`, `endTime`, `branchId?`, `employeeId?`,
    `isActive`, `createdAt?`, `updatedAt?` (V1 = Morning 08:30–16:30 / Night
    16:30–23:00; strings keep it extensible for weekend/custom shifts).
  - `ShiftModel` ([shift_model.dart](lib/features/shift/data/models/shift_model.dart))
    — Firestore (de)serialization for `shifts/{shiftId}`.
  - `ShiftRepository` (+ `ShiftRepositoryImpl`) and `ShiftRemoteDataSource`
    (+ `Impl`): `getAllShifts`, `getShiftsByBranch`, `getShift`,
    `getEmployeeShift`, `createShift`, `updateShift`, `deleteShift`,
    `assignEmployee`. Datasource throws `ServerException`; repo → `ServerFailure`.
- **Firestore rules** for `shifts/{shiftId}` using the existing
  `canReachBranch()` helper — admin: all branches; manager: own branch;
  employee: their own assigned shift (read-only). First branch-scoped collection.
- **Three role placeholder screens** (`shift_management_screen` [admin],
  `branch_shift_screen` [manager], `my_shift_screen` [employee]) at
  `/admin/shifts`, `/manager/shifts`, `/my-shift`, reachable via a **Shifts icon**
  in the shared `RoleScaffold` (`RouteNames.shiftsForRole`).
- `AppConstants.shiftsCollection`; `AppDependencies.shiftRepository` (DI wiring,
  ready for the shift UI to consume next phase).

### Notes
- Reuses the existing `users/{uid}.assignedShift` field (references the assigned
  `shiftId`) — the user model was **not** redesigned.
- Admin/manager shift routes are covered by the existing `_isAdminArea` /
  `_isManagerArea` route guards; `/my-shift` is self-scoped.
- The screens are functional placeholders only; the CRUD/assignment UI and the
  `users.assignedShift` sync on assignment land in the next phase.

---

## 2026-06-14 — Account approval flow & Welcome removal

Reworks the authentication entry flow for an internal ops tool: no public
marketing page, and new accounts must be approved before they can be used.

### Added
- `ApprovalStatus` enum (`pending` / `approved` / `rejected`) in
  [core/enums/approval_status.dart](lib/core/enums/approval_status.dart) with
  safe string (de)serialization that defaults unknown/missing → `approved` so
  legacy user documents are never locked out.
- `approvalStatus` field on `UserEntity` / `UserModel`, plus
  `UserEntity.isApproved` and `UserEntity.hasAppAccess` (`isApproved &&
  isActive`) computed getters.
- **Pending Approval screen** ([pending_approval_page.dart](lib/features/auth/presentation/pages/pending_approval_page.dart),
  route `/pending-approval`): the holding screen for authenticated-but-unapproved
  accounts. Polls `AuthCubit.refreshUser` so an approval lands the user in their
  role shell without a re-login; offers Sign Out.
- `AuthCubit.refreshUser` — re-reads the Firestore user and re-emits
  `authenticated` so the router re-evaluates access.
- **Approval gate** in the router redirect (checked **before** role dispatch):
  `!user.hasAppAccess` → confined to `/pending-approval`.

### Changed
- **New accounts are seeded `pending` + `isActive: false`** (employee, no branch)
  in the `saveUser` first-creation block; `approvalStatus` joins the
  seeded-once / excluded-from-`toMap()` privileged fields.
- **`firestore.rules`**: self-registration now requires `isActive == false` &&
  `approvalStatus == 'pending'`; employees can't change `approvalStatus`;
  **managers** can approve/manage employees of their **own branch** (and claim
  pending newcomers into it) without elevating role/branch; admins approve
  anyone; managers can read pending newcomers.
- Unauthenticated landing is now **Login** (router redirect + `SplashPage`);
  `LoginPage` shows a back button only when it can pop.

### Removed
- The social-style **Welcome / marketing page** (`welcome_page.dart`) and the
  `/welcome` route — FBRO is an internal tool, not a social network.

### Notes
- No in-app approval UI yet: approval is done out of band (Firebase console),
  like role promotion. The **first admin** must be bootstrapped there
  (`role: admin`, `approvalStatus: approved`, `isActive: true`) since every
  sign-up is seeded pending.

---

## 2026-06-14 — Role architecture refinement

Refines the Phase 1 foundation into a role **hierarchy** + **branch-scoped**
access model, before Phase 2. No model fields changed.

### Changed
- **Access model defined:** **admin** = global (not branch-restricted, can do
  everything a manager can — *admin ⊇ manager*); **manager** = limited to their
  own branch (`resource.branchId == manager.branchId`); **employee** = own data
  only. Documented on `UserRole` and mirrored in `firestore.rules`.
- **Route guard** now respects the hierarchy: admin areas stay admin-only, but
  **manager areas admit admins too**; employee home (`/`) stays employee-only.
- **`firestore.rules` rewritten** around reusable `isAdmin()` / `isManager()` /
  `selfBranch()` / `canReachBranch()` helpers: managers can read users **in
  their own branch**, admins read/write **any** user (promotion, branch move,
  (de)activation), employees keep self-only access with role fields locked.
  Added a commented template for Phase 2+ branch-scoped collections (branches,
  shifts, tasks).

### Added
- `UserRole.isAdmin` / `isManager` / `isEmployee` / `isGlobal` getters.

---

## 2026-06-14 — Phase 1: Roles & Foundation

Establishes the role system every later phase depends on.

### Added
- `UserRole` enum (`admin` / `manager` / `employee`) in
  [core/enums/user_role.dart](lib/core/enums/user_role.dart) with safe
  string (de)serialization that defaults unknown values to `employee`.
- Role foundation fields on `UserEntity` / `UserModel`: `role`, `branchId`,
  `isActive`, `assignedShift`.
- **Role seeding**: new users are seeded `role: employee`, `isActive: true`
  **once** on first `users/{uid}` creation; these fields are excluded from
  `toMap()` so re-login merges never reset an admin-assigned role/branch.
- **Role-based routing**: `RouteNames.homeForRole` + router redirect dispatch
  each user to their role shell after login.
- **Role guards**: per-area guards in `app_router.dart` bounce any user out of
  another role's area (incl. manual URL hacking); `/profile` & `/settings`
  remain shared.
- Three role shells + screens: `AdminShell`/`AdminDashboardScreen`,
  `ManagerShell`/`ManagerHomeScreen`, `EmployeeShell`/`EmployeeHomeScreen`,
  plus shared `RoleScaffold` and `RolePlaceholder` widgets
  (`features/{admin,manager,employee}`, `core/widgets`).
- Security rules committed: [`firestore.rules`](firestore.rules) (owner-only
  access; self-elevation of role fields forbidden) and
  [`storage.rules`](storage.rules), wired into [`firebase.json`](firebase.json).

### Changed
- `AuthCubit` now re-reads the Firestore user after email/Google/OTP sign-in so
  the emitted `authenticated` state carries the authoritative role/branch for
  routing.
- `SplashPage` dispatches authenticated users via `RouteNames.homeForRole`.

### Removed
- `features/home/home_page.dart` (the generic Home screen) — its UI moved into
  `EmployeeHomeScreen`; `/` now renders `EmployeeShell`.

### Notes
- FBRO is a **role-based branch/shift operations app, not a social network**.
  The legacy social counter fields on `ProfileEntity` are unused and slated for
  removal in a future cleanup.
- Rules still need deploying; role promotion is done out of band until the
  Phase 5 admin console.

---

## 2026-06-14 — Redesign & production profile system

### Added
- **Profile module** (`features/profile`): full view + edit, Firestore-backed
  `ProfileEntity` (identity, personal, account, social counters, presence,
  privacy settings), avatar/cover upload to Firebase Storage with live progress,
  and case-insensitive username availability checks.
- `ProfileCubit` with optimistic, flicker-free save flow (keeps last-known
  profile visible across `saving`/`error`).
- Settings module (`features/settings`): settings page + change password; delete
  account flow.
- Design system: monochrome black & white theme with white accent
  (`AppColors`, `AppTypography`, `AppSpacing`, `AppRadius`, `AppTheme`).
- FBRO branding (`FbroLogo` wordmark), shared `AppSnackbar` and `Skeleton`
  widgets, custom page transitions (fade/slide).
- Enhanced Google authentication configuration (Info.plist / settings).

### Fixed
- Per-action loading: `AuthState.loading` now carries an `AuthAction` so only
  the triggering button shows a spinner (fixes "every button spins on Google
  sign-in").

### Notes / follow-ups
- Requires Firebase **Storage enabled** and **Firestore security rules** to be
  configured for production.
- Social counters and presence fields are schema-ready but not yet
  backend-driven.

---

## 2026-06-13 — Authentication feature set

### Added
- Email/password sign-in & registration, phone OTP sign-in, Google sign-in.
- Forgot password, email verification (send + poll), change password,
  delete account.
- Session restore on cold start (`AuthCubit.restoreSession`) and auth-aware
  routing via `go_router` redirects (`_AuthStateNotifier`).
- Firestore user document: saved on registration (`users/{uid}`), loaded to
  restore session, surfaced on the Home screen.
- Clean Architecture scaffold: `core/` (di, errors, routes, theme, widgets,
  constants) and `features/auth` across data/domain/presentation layers.
- Auth UI + design system foundations (Phase 2).

### Refactored
- Completed Firebase authentication integration end-to-end (datasources →
  repository → use cases → cubit → pages).
