# DROP — Project Context

> **How DROP is built.** Architecture, module map, and the conventions every
> contributor (human or AI) must follow. Read this first; read nothing else unless
> the task needs it.

## The documentation set

Each document has **one** responsibility. A fact lives in exactly one of them.

| Document | Answers | Read it when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **PROJECT_CONTEXT.md** (this) | How is this built? | Always, first |
| [CURRENT_STATE.md](CURRENT_STATE.md) | Where are we today? | Starting any task |
| [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) | What happened when? | You need history |
| [docs/design/](docs/design/) | How does *this feature* work? | Touching that feature |
| [docs/decisions/](docs/decisions/) | Why, and don't re-litigate | Proposing a change that reverses something |
| [docs/QA.md](docs/QA.md) | How do we verify a release? | Before shipping |

**If code and docs disagree, the code wins.** Verify against the code, then fix the
doc in the same task. Never leave a doc contradicting the code — that is how the
previous documentation set grew to 11,000 lines of partly-false claims.

## 1. What DROP is

**DROP — Operations Management System.** An internal, role-based operations tool for
**DROP THE SHOP**: branches, shifts, tasks, attendance, approvals, and employee
activity. Three roles — **admin · manager · employee**.

It is **not** a social network, an ERP, an analytics engine, or a SaaS product. It
has no buyers, only users: a small, known set of people across a handful of
branches.

### Core philosophy

Read [ADR-010](docs/decisions/ADR-010-lean-over-enterprise.md) before proposing
anything large. In short:

- **Workflow over architecture. UX over feature count.**
- **Default to deletion.** The burden of proof is on keeping a feature, not cutting
  it. Schedule Health and the analytics pipeline were both deleted *after* shipping.
- **Simple > clever. Signal > volume.** No abstraction without a second caller.
- **Stability > perfection.** 90% complete with zero regressions beats 100% with
  risk.
- **Premium, not minimal.** Lean is about *count*, not *craft*.
- **Learn from mature products (Deputy, Connecteam, Sling); never copy them** —
  they solve a scale problem DROP does not have.

Classify every change (**bug / polish / refactor / feature**) and label its risk
(**LOW / MED / HIGH**). Lead with operational impact.

### Product shape

- **Admin-provisioned auth.** No public registration, no OTP, no Google sign-in.
  An admin creates accounts via the `createUserAccount` Cloud Function; the
  unauthenticated landing screen is **Login** only.
- **First-login gate**, in order: `mustChangePassword` → Force Password Change ·
  `!isProfileCompleted` → Profile Completion · (employees only)
  `!hasCompletedOnboarding` → one-time Welcome · then the role home. The ordering
  is the pure, unit-tested `firstLoginLocation(user)`.
- **admin ⊇ manager.** An admin can do anything a manager can, across every branch.

> Some legacy social fields (follower/post counters) linger in the profile schema
> from an earlier iteration. They are **unused** — do not build on them.

## 2. Tech stack

| Concern | Choice | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Language | Dart `^3.12.1` / Flutter | |
| State | `flutter_bloc` — **Cubits only** | [ADR-002](docs/decisions/ADR-002-cubit-only.md) |
| Navigation | `go_router` | Auth-aware redirects + role guards |
| Backend | Firebase: Auth · Firestore · Storage | [ADR-001](docs/decisions/ADR-001-firebase-backend.md) |
| Server logic | Cloud Functions (Node.js, `functions/`) | 21 functions; see [DATA_MODEL](docs/design/DATA_MODEL.md) |
| Push | `firebase_messaging` | iOS unconfigured — see CURRENT_STATE |
| Immutable models | `freezed` + `freezed_annotation` | Entities & states |
| Serialization | `json_serializable` | |
| Media | `image_picker` · `image_cropper` · `video_compress` | Mobile-gated |
| Location | `geolocator` | Attendance GPS |
| Secure storage | `flutter_secure_storage` | |
| Codegen | `build_runner` | |

**Platforms:** iOS · Android · macOS. Desktop is a first-class target, not an
afterthought — see [§7](#7-ui-philosophy).

## 3. Architecture

**Clean Architecture, sliced by feature.** The dependency rule points **inward**:

```
presentation  →  domain  ←  data
```

```
features/<feature>/
├── data/            # The ONLY place Firebase exists
│   ├── datasources/ #   Talk to Firebase; throw *Exception
│   ├── models/      #   All serialization: toMap/fromMap, toEntity/fromEntity
│   └── repositories/#   Implement domain contracts; *Exception → *Failure
├── domain/          # Pure Dart. NEVER imports Flutter or Firebase.
│   ├── entities/    #   freezed business objects
│   ├── repositories/#   Abstract contracts
│   └── usecases/    #   One class per action, callable via .call()
└── presentation/    # Cubits, pages, widgets. Sees entities only.
```

`domain/` depends on nothing. This is why ~880 tests run in ~16 seconds with no
Firebase and no widget tree — business rules are pure functions.

Full rationale and costs: [ADR-003](docs/decisions/ADR-003-clean-architecture.md).

### Composition root

`main.dart` → `AppDependencies.init()` ([lib/core/di/injection.dart](lib/core/di/injection.dart))
wires every datasource, repository, use case, and cubit **by hand** — no DI package.

- **App-wide cubits** are provided in `main.dart` via `MultiBlocProvider`:
  `auth` · `profile` · `task` · `branch` · `adminUsers` · `statistics` · `schedule` ·
  `shiftSwap` · `branchOperations` · `broadcast` · `notification` · `caseList` ·
  `requestsList` · `attendance`.
- **Per-entity cubits** are built on demand by `AppDependencies.create*` —
  `createCaseConversationCubit`, `createRequestDetailCubit`.

### Cold start

`LaunchApp` in `main.dart` coordinates above the router. Flutter paints a black
frame first, then Firebase → DI → `AuthCubit.restoreSession()` → authoritative
user-doc read → home-critical preload, **in parallel** with `SplashPage` running the
launch intro. The routed app mounts only when **both** complete. `createRouter`
takes a resolved `initialLocation`, so no splash replay.

### Server-authoritative boundary

Anything a client must not forge is written by the Admin SDK — task transitions,
attendance audit, swap approval, account provisioning, broadcast sends. See
[ADR-005](docs/decisions/ADR-005-server-authoritative-writes.md) for the full table.

## 4. Module map

17 features in `lib/features/`. Detail lives in the linked design doc — not here.

| Module | Owns | Design doc |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `auth` | Sign-in, forgot/force password change, profile completion, Welcome, roles | [AUTH](docs/design/AUTH.md) |
| `profile` | View/edit profile, image uploads, contact & payment details | [AUTH](docs/design/AUTH.md) |
| `task` | The operations task workflow: create → execute → review | [TASKS](docs/design/TASKS.md) |
| `schedule` | Weekly roster, shift swaps, shift templates, leave, Final View | [SCHEDULE](docs/design/SCHEDULE.md) |
| `attendance` | GPS clock in/out, corrections, admin board, geofences | [ATTENDANCE](docs/design/ATTENDANCE.md) |
| `requests` | Employee → manager yes/no approvals | [REQUESTS](docs/design/REQUESTS.md) |
| `cases` | Private employee ↔ manager/admin conversations | [CASES](docs/design/CASES.md) |
| `communications` | Broadcasts, templates, schedules, reminders | [COMMUNICATIONS](docs/design/COMMUNICATIONS.md) |
| `notifications` | Notification inbox + deep-link resolver | [NOTIFICATIONS](docs/design/NOTIFICATIONS.md) |
| `operations` | Branch Operations cockpit: workload, KPI drills | [TASKS](docs/design/TASKS.md) |
| `admin` | User administration, Admin Home command center | [DESIGN_SYSTEM](docs/design/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md) |
| `branch` | Branch CRUD, geofences, swap policy | [ATTENDANCE](docs/design/ATTENDANCE.md) |
| `statistics` | Role-scoped counts powering all three dashboards | — |
| `audit` | `EventTrackingService` + audit log entities | [AUDIT_LOG](docs/design/AUDIT_LOG.md) |
| `manager` | ManagerShell + manager home | — |
| `employee` | EmployeeShell + employee home | — |
| `settings` | Settings + change password (presentation-only) | — |

`manager`, `employee`, and `settings` are **presentation-only** — they reuse other
features' cubits.

### Core (`lib/core/`)

| Directory | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `constants/` | `app_constants.dart` — app name, collection names |
| `di/` | `injection.dart` — the hand-wired service locator |
| `enums/` | Shared enums (`user_role`, `task_*`, `schedule_*`, `attendance_*`, …) |
| `errors/` | `exceptions.dart` (data) · `failures.dart` (domain) |
| `extensions/` | `context_extensions` (currentUser/role) · `firestore_extensions` (`map.date`) |
| `media/` | `MediaUploadService` — the **single** Storage seam for all attachments |
| `observability/` | `CrashReporter` (4 funnels → persisted report) + `CrashContext` |
| `responsive/` | `breakpoints.dart` |
| `routes/` | `app_router.dart` (role dispatch + guards) · `route_names.dart` (43 routes) |
| `services/` | `notification_service.dart` (FCM) · `case_seen_store.dart` |
| `theme/` | `app_colors` · `app_typography` · `app_spacing` · `app_radius` · `app_theme` |
| `utils/` | `validators` · `platform_capabilities` · `app_logger` · `app_date_formatter` · `concurrent` |
| `widgets/` | Every cross-feature widget — see [§7](#7-ui-philosophy) |

**`core/` must never import a feature.** Apply feature-specific behaviour at the
call site through an exposed hook (e.g. `AttentionTile.radius`), not inside the
primitive.

### Single-source seams

Reuse these. Do not re-implement or duplicate them.

| Concern | The one source |
| --- | --- |
| Any `DateTime` → string | `core/utils/app_date_formatter.dart` |
| Any Storage upload | `core/media/media_upload_service.dart` |
| Task status → colour | `core/widgets/status_badge.dart` (`taskStatusColor`) |
| Structured logging | `core/utils/app_logger.dart` (`AppLog`) |
| Shift slot timing | `schedule/domain/shift_window.dart` |
| Shift hours resolution | `WeeklyScheduleEntity.hoursFor` ([ADR-006](docs/decisions/ADR-006-schedule-shift-plan-snapshots.md)) |
| Worked/late/overtime minutes | `attendance/domain/attendance_calculator.dart` |
| Task visibility | `task/domain/task_access.dart` (`canUserAccessTask`) |
| Notification routing | `notifications/domain/notification_deep_link.dart` |
| Sidebar + command palette | `AppShell.sectionsForRole` |

---

## 5. Where to change things

> Act without scanning. Feature detail is in the design docs.

| To change… | Edit |
| --- | --- |
| A new action in any feature | `domain/usecases/` → repository contract + impl → datasource → cubit → **`core/di/injection.dart`** |
| Any entity or state shape | the `freezed` file, **then run codegen** |
| Routes / navigation guards | `core/routes/app_router.dart` + `route_names.dart` |
| Role chrome (bottom nav) | `core/widgets/role_scaffold.dart` + `app_bottom_nav.dart` |
| Desktop chrome (sidebar, ⌘K) | `core/widgets/app_shell.dart` + `app_sidebar.dart` + `command_palette.dart` |
| Colours / type / spacing / radius | `core/theme/` — never inline a `Color(...)` or `TextStyle(...)` |
| Global component styling | `core/theme/app_theme.dart` |
| Firestore / Storage security | `firestore.rules` · `storage.rules` → **deploy** |
| Server logic | `functions/index.js` → **deploy** |
| Collection names / app name | `core/constants/app_constants.dart` |
| DI wiring | `core/di/injection.dart` |
| App bootstrap / providers | `main.dart` |

---

## 6. Coding standards

Established across the codebase and **must be reused**.

### Folders & naming

- Feature-first: `features/<feature>/{data,domain,presentation}`.
- `snake_case.dart` files, one primary class each. Generated files sit beside their
  source as `*.freezed.dart` / `*.g.dart`.
- Classes `PascalCase`; members `camelCase`; private deps `_underscored`.
- Datasources `XRemoteDataSource` + `Impl`. Repositories `XRepository` + `Impl`.
  Use cases are a **verb phrase** (`SignInWithEmail`). Cubits `XCubit`, states
  `XState`, pages `XPage`, entities `XEntity`.

### Use cases

One class = one action. Stateless, holds only its repository, `const` constructor
taking it positionally, single `call(...)` method invoked as `useCase(...)`. Named
params when there is more than one.

### Repositories & datasources

- Contract in `domain/repositories`, impl in `data/repositories`.
- The impl depends on datasources only — **never on Firebase directly**.
- Wrap every datasource call in `try/catch`, converting `*Exception` → `*Failure`.
- Convert `Model → Entity` before returning. The rest of the app sees entities only.
- Datasources receive the Firebase SDK instance via constructor (injected in
  `injection.dart`), catch `FirebaseException`, and throw a domain-agnostic
  `*Exception` with a user-readable message.

### Cubits

- Extend `Cubit<XState>`; inject use cases (and the repository for streams) via a
  named-param constructor. Start at `XState.initial()`.
- Guard double-submits with a `_busy` getter inspecting current state.
- Emit **loading** → `await` → success or error. Carry an action discriminator on
  loading (`AuthState.loading(AuthAction.x)`) so only the triggering button spins.
- Catch `XFailure` → `XState.error(e.message)`; catch-all → a generic friendly
  message.
- For optimistic flows keep the last-known entity visible across transient states
  (`ProfileState.saving(profile)`), and on error re-emit `loaded(previous)` so the
  UI never flickers or loses data.
- **Cancel stream subscriptions in `close()`.**

### States, entities & models

- States are `freezed` unions; one factory per distinct UI state; success/transient
  states carry their data. Read with `maybeWhen` / `mapOrNull` / `maybeMap`.
- Entities are `freezed` in `domain/entities`, `@Default(...)` for non-null
  optionals, computed getters via a private `const X._()` constructor.
- Models own all (de)serialization, bridge `Timestamp ⇄ DateTime`, tolerate missing
  keys with defaults, and keep legacy keys in sync on write.
- Prefer **additive** schema changes — a new nullable field needs no migration.

### Codegen

After touching any `freezed` file:

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Testing

- Pure domain functions are the unit of test. Inject `now` / `day` so they are
  deterministic.
- Widget tests must **unmount** anything driving a `Timer` (e.g. the live countdown
  pill) or the test hangs.
- `EntranceFade` needs a frame-pump before a timed pump.

## 7. UI philosophy

**Strictly monochrome, dark mode only.** `AppColors.primary` is **white** and is the
only accent. The only chromatic colours are semantic `success` / `error` / `warning`,
and they express **status only**.

This is the single most re-litigated decision in DROP — read
[ADR-004](docs/decisions/ADR-004-monochrome-design.md) **before** proposing a brand
colour.

- **Calm through hierarchy, not reduction.** DROP is premium, not minimal. A 4-step
  grey ramp (`FFFFFF` / `A7A7AF` / `6E6E77` / `48484E`) does the work colour would;
  **no two adjacent texts share a grey**.
- **Never replace a lived-in UI without sign-off.** "Work on it more" means
  *enrich*, not *simplify*. Motion is often load-bearing (`LiveStatusBorder`'s orbit
  is a spec, not decoration).
- **One primary CTA per screen.**
- Task action sheets may use neutral tonal depth, restrained entrance/stagger motion,
  and pointer lift feedback; chromatic colour remains semantic-only and reduced
  motion must collapse these transitions.
- Every widget: a Semantics label, ≥44px targets, honours reduced motion, renders
  collections lazily/capped.

### Reuse, don't rebuild

| Need | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Buttons | `AppButton` (`primary`/`secondary`/`ghost`, built-in `isLoading`) · `PremiumButton` (compact inline) |
| Card surface | `GlassContainer` — the shared gradient/border/depth surface |
| Page header | `PageHero` (eyebrow · title · subtitle · one CTA) |
| Triage cell | `AttentionTile` (monochrome at zero, tints only when there's work) |
| Fact row | `StatStrip` |
| Feed row | `ActivityCard` |
| Status pill | `StatusBadge` (`.task` is canonical) |
| Empty state | `DropEmptyState` |
| Loading | `Skeleton` / `DropLoadingState` |
| Feedback | `AppSnackbar.success/error` — never raw `ScaffoldMessenger` |
| Spacing / radius | `AppSpacing` / `AppRadius` — never hardcode |

New surfaces compose the Design System V2 primitives — see
[docs/design/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md](docs/design/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md).

### Adaptive shell

- **Mobile/tablet:** AppBar + `AppBottomNav` via `RoleScaffold`.
- **Desktop:** persistent role-aware `AppSidebar` via `AppShell` (a `ShellRoute`),
  ⌘1–⌘9 jump to destinations, ⌘K opens the command palette.
- Pages use `AdaptiveScaffold` (mobile AppBar ⇄ desktop page header).

> ⚠️ **Never wrap the `ShellRoute` child in an `AnimatedSwitcher` or keyed
> cross-fade.** It is go_router's shell Navigator (a `GlobalKey`); mounting it twice
> duplicates the key and froze all macOS navigation. The desktop fade lives at the
> page level in `app_router.dart`.

---

## 8. Development workflow

### Adding a feature

Follow it through **all** layers, in order:

```
datasource → repository (contract + impl) → use case → cubit/state → page
          → wire in injection.dart → (if routed) app_router.dart + route_names.dart
```

Then run codegen if any `freezed` file changed.

### Access model

Mirrored in `firestore.rules` — the client is never the enforcement point.

| Role | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| **admin** | Global. Not restricted by `branchId`. Can do everything a manager can, everywhere. |
| **manager** | Exactly one branch; limited to `resource.branchId == manager.branchId`. |
| **employee** | Own assigned data and profile. **Read-only exception:** any branch member may *read* other `users` in their own branch (the schedule needs it). Writes to user docs stay admin-only. |

- Parse roles with `UserRole.fromString`, which **defaults unknown/missing to
  `employee`** so a bad document can never escalate privileges. Use the
  `isAdmin`/`isManager`/`isEmployee`/`isGlobal` getters.
- **Never gate role access in the UI only.** Add a role area as a path prefix with an
  `_isXArea` helper + a guard line in the router, and extend `RouteNames.homeForRole`.
- Privileged fields (`role`, `branchId`, `isActive`, `position`, `createdBy`,
  `mustChangePassword`, `isProfileCompleted`, …) are kept **out of
  `UserModel.toMap()`** so routine profile writes cannot reset admin-owned state.

Rule detail per collection: [docs/design/DATA_MODEL.md](docs/design/DATA_MODEL.md).

### Before finishing any task

1. `flutter analyze` — clean.
2. `flutter test` — no **new** failures (see CURRENT_STATE for known ones).
3. Update **CURRENT_STATE.md** if status, gaps, or priorities moved.
4. Append a **CHANGELOG.md** line.
5. Update the **design doc** if you changed how a feature works.
6. Write an **ADR** if you made or reversed an architectural decision.
7. Update **this file** only if the architecture, a convention, or a module changed.

### Documentation rules

These exist because the previous doc set reached 11,000 lines and started
contradicting itself — it claimed indigo was the accent months after it was deleted,
and gave three different test counts in one file.

- **One fact, one home.** Never restate a feature's design in more than one doc. Link
  instead.
- **Summarize on the way out.** A CHANGELOG entry loses detail as it ages; it does
  not live at full length forever. Git has the detail.
- **CURRENT_STATE.md is today only.** The moment something is history, it belongs in
  the CHANGELOG.
- **Deleted docs are not lost** — `git show <sha>:<file>` recovers anything. Never
  keep a stale doc "just in case", and never create an archive directory.
- **Prefer bullets over paragraphs, tables over prose.**
